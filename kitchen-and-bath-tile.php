        <h2>The Kitchen</h2>
        <p>
          The kitchen is the very heart of the modern home. Contemporary homeowners are looking for kitchens that make it easy to create intimate Sunday brunches or a formal meal for dozens of guests. Kitchen tile fits in nicely with many types of materials commonly seen in the kitchen including stone, brass and glass. The homeowner can place tile along the back to add a backsplash full of color. Tile can serve many other purposes in the kitchen. Use it as countertops or to add a unique picture that can serve as a focal point in the kitchen.

        <h2>Upscale Bathrooms</h2>
        <p>
          Tile works equally well in the bathroom. Bath tile is both practical and elegant. Use it to make a smaller bathroom look unified and larger. Bring it in a large bathroom to make cleaning a snap. Tile can be found in many varied types, colors and styles. Glass tile adds light and color to any bath that might otherwise feel dark. Tile made from materials such as granite and stone adds heft and turns any bathroom into a personal and inviting retreat. Even a small tiled area can add instant appeal for the homeowner and remind any future buyer of the owner's appreciation of quality details.
