        <h1>Our Legacy</h1>
        <p>
          This has been a Shears family business since its inception. Our project is to earn a living while still retaining a sense of satisfaction in what we do. Therefore, every time we have been offered a buyout from a larger competitor, we have refused. We love what we do, and we have watched many of them go under. Spartacus Tile is still here.

        <h2>The First Location</h2>
        <p>
          There's always a certain emotional attachment for business owners as regards their first office. That is the case with Spartacus Tile as well, even if that first place was the basement of an office building. 
        </p>
        <p>
          You have to start somewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are grateful that our hard work has paid off; our operation has gone from that tiny basement space to occupying the larger half of Windermere Plaza, one of the most frequented corners in the tri-city area.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most companies don't need such office space, but we find it necessary for some clients to have hands-on experience with the different types of flooring we offer.

        <h2>The Importance of Artisan Training</h2>
        <p>
          All of our employees are graduates of the local Academy of Industry and Labor Management. In fact, we recruit directly and refuse to hire anyone who is not trained.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among our competitors, there are many great tilers whose work we respect who did not do any formal training, but it is crucial to what we do. At Spartacus Tile, we do not have laborers; we have artists, or as most call them in industries like ours, "artisans."

        <h2>Our Plans for the Future</h2>
        <p>
          We want to expand, but a corporate expansion is not our vision. When Sam retires, we are keeping it in the family (though we haven't decided who takes it). This way, we can keep true to our small business roots.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if we can be a non-corporate entity and do work allover the country/world, we would have no complaints. We simply don't want any investors interfering with our artistic endeavors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, don't think that our attitude will prevent us from doing the job you want; we are here for the customer!
