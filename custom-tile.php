        <h1>The Benefits of Custom Tile</h1>
        <p>
          The addition of custom tile to a floor or a backsplash is an excellent way to improve the value and the durability of your home. Whether you plan to stay and refinance or sell, tile can make your home more attractive and easier to care for.

        <h2>From the Front Door and Beyond</h2>
        <p>
          Your home flooring may take a serious beating, depending on the habits of the occupants. Installing a beautiful tile floor at the front door or in a mudroom can save you a great deal of cleaning time and give your home a dramatic entrance.

        <h2>Why Not Make a Picture?</h2>
        <p>
          Once your entryway is both more durable and more beautiful, the opportunities for tile are amazing. From a mosaic treatment of a backsplash to a tiled fireplace surround, you can turn an ordinary stretch of wall into a striking and beautiful feature with the application of custom tile.

        <h2>Staying Within Budget</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most exciting features about a custom tile installation is that you can put the majority of your money into the custom application you want as the focus of the project and fill in the rest of the space with a less costly field tile.
        </p>
        <p>
          When making your tile choices, try to choose a design that offers a stretch of plain tile around your feature. This area of visual rest will make your custom tile design even more eye-catching and may reduce the expense of the installation.

        <h2>Work With A Professional</h2>
        <p>
          Once the tile is installed and grouted, it should function as a solid piece of flooring or wall art. However, if the base isn't solid, your tile project may develop cracks or the grout can fail and come up between the tile.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working with a tiling professional is critical to making sure that your project looks great and stands the test of time.
